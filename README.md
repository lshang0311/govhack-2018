BCGDV GovHack 2018

Early intervention for people and companies that are at risk of conviction for insolvency.

This is the PoC code. The data model is a limited subset and can be improved with even greater accuracy.
For the purposes of this hack, we used a smaller slice of the feature set so that the UI could be built in time.

Machine learning techniques have been used to solve a few problems with the dataset:
1. Class Imbalance
2. Probability of conviction on insolvency

The final dataset is a combination of multiple ones which can be found on the hackerspace page:
